<blockquote>
This is a rough draft of an ecommerce website.  It is fully functional in test mode.  Use card number 4242-4242-4242-4242 when attempting a purchase.
The intention behind the style of the project was collectable, however with more development an admin panel will be added which can give users permissions to add remove, and change product prices</blockquote>
